# 🚀Terraforming Titans

Generative AI 🤖 enabled similar PRSU accumulator 

## 🔎Problem

Various teams including 🧑‍💻Engineers, 👨‍💻TechOps, 👨‍💻Ops, and 👨‍💻PMs are currently investing significant time in resolving PRSU tickets

This process often involves addressing recurring issues, which not only consumes valuable time but also requires the involvement of engineers with specific expertise and context

## 𝌣Proposed Solution

We have build a 📑Generative AI model on top of LLM model 🤖Llama-2-7b-hf, which can find similar past issues for us along with 🎯**resolutions**

### 🧐How much time we spend now on recurring issues now?

### 👥We see recurring issues all around the organisation

🔥We see issues on production for all teams across PayU and at different levels, like PRSU, Ops, Bugs

♾We can use our Gen AI to find top issues to resolve permanently

⚙️We can also automate resolving sandbox issues. As we see a lot of repeated issues on sandbox
